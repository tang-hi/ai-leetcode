# LeetCode LLM Solver

This project aims to automatically solve LeetCode problems using different LLM (Language Learning Model) models. The project fetches the problem statement from LeetCode, uses an LLM model to generate a solution, and then submits the solution to LeetCode to check if it passes the test cases.
